## 🌾 About the Project

Sowing seeds manually is a time-consuming and labor-intensive task. This project automates the seed sowing process using an Arduino-based robotic system equipped with motors, sensors, and a seed dispensing mechanism. The robot moves autonomously, detects obstacles, and drops seeds at predefined intervals, ensuring uniform distribution and better crop yield.

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **Initialization:** Arduino sets up pins for motors, sensors, and seed dispenser.  
2. **Obstacle Detection:** Ultrasonic sensor scans ahead; robot stops or navigates around obstacles.  
3. **Seed Sowing:** Motor-driven mechanism picks a precise amount of seeds and drops them at regular intervals.  
4. **Movement:** Robot moves forward a predefined distance between seed drops for uniform spacing.  
5. **Soil Monitoring:** (If included) Moisture sensor checks soil suitability before sowing.  
6. **Repeat:** The cycle continues until the end of the field or predefined path.
